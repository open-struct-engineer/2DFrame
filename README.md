# 2DFrame
A repository to house various methods associated with 2DFrames in various programing languages for use in Structural Analysis.

Solutions are based on traidional methods such as slope-deflection or moment distriubtion. FEM Stiffness Matrix Analysis of 2DFrames will be handled by another repository.
